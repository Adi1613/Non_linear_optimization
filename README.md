# Past demand simulation(by solving non linear objective function)
Simulation of actual demand of electricity load.


In this problem designed one optimization model which simulates the actual electricity load demand for the previous years for a state. In this model minimized one non linear objective function with constraints related to load consumption in the state and two peak and off peak points are known. And taking the instate electricity production as constarints for the problem. Used Scipy package and pyomo for this non linear constrained problem.
