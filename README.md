# Non_linear_optimization
simulation of actual demand of electricity load.


In this problem I have designed one optimization model which simulates the actual electricity load demand for the previous years for a state. In this model I have minimized one non linear objective function with constraints related to load consumption in the state. And taking the instate electricity production as constarints for the problem. I have used Scipy package in Python for this non linear constrained problem.
